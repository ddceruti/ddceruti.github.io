Hi there! Nice to meet you. My name is Amedeo Ceruti. I am a chemical engineer from Barcelona, Spain. I will be publishing blog posts about my current and past research, as well as other unrelated topics which I am interested in.

### Research interests

My research interests are modeling and optimization of (chemical process) systems with first-principle, data-driven or hybrid approaches. My main goal is to use the knwoledge provided by these tools to optimize and design more sustainable processes of all sorts while applying a systems engineering perspective. Therefore, I am interested in sustainability metrics, programming, mathematical optimization, machine learning models, amongst others. I am currently completing a 6-month reasearch stay at the SUPERLAB at the ETH ZÃ¼rich and looking for a suitable PhD-programmfor me beginning April 2022.

### CV

You can download my CV [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/images/20210928_CV.pdf) or see an embedded version [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/cv/).

### Hobbies

I enjoy playing water polo and reading in my free time. Also, I am always excited to find new local museums, libraries and bookshops!
