Hi there! Nice to meet you. My name is Amedeo Ceruti. 

I am a chemical engineer from Barcelona, Spain. I post blog entries about my current and past research, as well as other unrelated topics here.

### Research interests

My main research interests are modeling and optimization of energy and process systems with first-principle, data-driven or hybrid approaches. After a reasearch stay at the [SUPERLAB](https://superlab.ethz.ch/) at the ETH ZÃ¼rich in 2021, I started my PhD at TU Munich at the [Chair of Energy Systems](https://www.epe.ed.tum.de/en/es/homepage/) in March 2022. Currently I am working on  cross-coupled optimization of energy systems with a focus on renewable heat supply. To achieve this, I am using tools such as mixed integer linear programming (MILP), robust optimization and stochastic programming. 
More broadly, I am interested in energy systems, sustainability metrics (LCA, planetary boundaries), optimization (under uncertainty), machine learning, amongst others. Ultimately, my goal is to use the knwoledge provided by "tools" to design sustainable processes of all sorts while applying systems engineering and life cycle thinking perspectives. A particularly exciting question to me is the multi-scale nature of systems and how to navigate it to arrive at real-world "optimal" decisions. 

### CV

You can download my CV [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/images/2022-09-28_CV.pdf) or see an embedded version [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/cv/).

### Hobbies

I enjoy playing water polo and reading (currently reading "2666" by Roberto Bolano) in my free time. Also, I am always excited to visit local museums, libraries and bookshops!
