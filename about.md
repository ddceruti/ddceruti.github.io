Hi there! Nice to meet you. My name is Amedeo Ceruti. 

I am a chemical engineer from Barcelona, Spain. I post blog entries about my current and past research, as well as other unrelated topics here.

### Research interests

My main research interests are modeling and optimization of energy and process systems with first-principle, data-driven or hybrid approaches. My goal is to use the knwoledge provided by these tools to optimize and design more sustainable processes of all sorts while applying systems engineering and life cycle thinking perspectives. A particularly exciting topic is the multi-scale nature of systems and how to navigate it to arrive at real-world "optimal" decisions. Therefore, I am interested in sustainability metrics, programming, mathematical optimization, machine learning models, energy systems, amongst others. After a reasearch stay at the [SUPERLAB](https://superlab.ethz.ch/) at the ETH ZÃ¼rich, I started my PhD at TU Munich at the [Chair of Energy Systems](https://www.epe.ed.tum.de/en/es/homepage/) in March 2022.

### CV

You can download my CV [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/images/CV_Amedeo_Ceruti.pdf) or see an embedded version [here](https://ddceruti.github.io/cv/).

### Hobbies

I enjoy playing water polo and reading in my free time. Also, I am always excited to visit local museums, libraries and bookshops!
