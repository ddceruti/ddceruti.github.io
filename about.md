### Hi there!

Nice to meet you. My name is Amedeo Ceruti. I am a chemical engineer from Barcelona, Spain. I am currently studying at TU Munich, Germany.

### Research interests

My research interests are modeling and optimization of chemical processes with first-principle, data-driven or hybrid approaches. My main goal is to use the knwoledge provided by those models to optimize and design more sustainable processes of all sorts. Therefore, I am interested in sustainability metrics, programming, mathematical optimization, machine learning models, amongst others. I am currently looking for a PhD-programm in this topic or related ones.

I will be publishing some blog posts about my current and past research, as well as other unrelated topics which I am interested in.

### Hobbies

I enjoy playing water polo and reading in my free time. Also, I am always looking for new museums, libraries and bookshops!
