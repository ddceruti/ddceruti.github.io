title: Recently published article on ethane-based vinyl chloride synthesis
---

I am excited to share that a paper I worked on as a co-author with colleagues of the SUPERLAB at ETH ZÃ¼rich has just been published! It is titled: *Economic and Environmental Competitiveness of Ethane-Based Technologies for Vinyl Chloride Synthesis* and is open access: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c03006](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c03006). Thank you top Juan Diego Medrano for his work on this piece and of course to all co-authors for the great collaboration!
